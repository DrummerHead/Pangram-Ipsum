Another useful little tool, [filler text](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filler_text) using [pangrams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangram). In general Lorem Ipsum is used as filler text, but why not Zoidberg? I mean… why not pangrams? They were created because they use each of the letters of the alphabet once, and that’s useful for testing typography. But it also generates a more homogenuous visual texture.

In most situations using filler text is bad, because you should know what your content is going to be before visually designin something. But sometimes you’re creating content arquitecture, and even thou you know the objectives of each area and the kinds of contents, you haven’t genrated the content yet. I think that in these cases it’s allright to use filler text :)

Inside you’ll find the code ready to be put on source, with paragraphs increasing in word count so you can choose the size that best suits your needs.

Oh! And if you’re wondering what’s the deal with the &#8217; things, check this [handy utf-8 character reference](http://mcdlr.com/8/)
